## Linear Equation Basics

**Formula:**  
Linear Equation:  
`ax + b = 0`  
Solution:  
`x = -b / a`, where `a ≠ 0`

**Explanation:**  
A linear equation represents a straight line when plotted on a graph. Solving a linear equation means finding the value of `x` where the expression becomes zero.

**Steps to Solve:**  
1. Move constant term to the other side  
2. Divide by coefficient of `x`

**Example:**  
`2x + 4 = 0 → x = -2`

**Usage:**  
Used in solving one‑variable equations, coordinate geometry, and word problems.

## Quadratic Equation

**Standard Form:**  
`ax² + bx + c = 0`, where `a ≠ 0`

**Quadratic Formula:**  
`x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / (2a)`

**Discriminant:**  
`D = b² - 4ac`

**Nature of Roots:**  
- `D > 0` → Two real and distinct roots  
- `D = 0` → Two real and equal roots  
- `D < 0` → No real roots

**Example:**  
`x² - 5x + 6 = 0 → x = 2, 3`

**Usage:**  
Used in projectile motion, maxima‑minima problems, graph analysis, and JEE word problems.

## Algebraic Identities

### Square of Sum

**Formula:**  
`(a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b²`

**Explanation:**  
Expands the square of a sum into individual terms.

**Example:**  
`(x + 3)² = x² + 6x + 9`

---

### Square of Difference

**Formula:**  
`(a - b)² = a² - 2ab + b²`

**Example:**  
`(x - 4)² = x² - 8x + 16`

---

### Difference of Squares

**Formula:**  
`a² - b² = (a + b)(a - b)`

**Example:**  
`x² - 9 = (x + 3)(x - 3)`

**Usage:**  
Used in factorization, simplification, and solving quadratic equations.
